[Intro]
(Soft kirar melody)

[Verse 1]
In the highlands where the morning breaks
Ancient mountains as the world awakes
Coffee blooms beneath the golden light
Ethiopia rising with the night

[Chorus]
Habesha soul, burning bright
Dancing through the starlit night
From Addis to the world we sing
Our voices soar on eagle's wing

[Verse 2]
Rhythms echo through the cobbled streets
Where the old and new traditions meet
Masenqo cries and drums beat true
A thousand years, forever new

[Chorus]
Habesha soul, burning bright
Dancing through the starlit night
From Addis to the world we sing
Our voices soar on eagle's wing

[Bridge]
(Eskista dance break)
Feel the spirit, let it flow
Ancient wisdom, watch it grow

[Outro]
Ethiopia, land of gold
Stories waiting to be told
